# Hangman

Just a simple program to test out basic functions and logic in Python.

The classic Hangman game where you select a word/phrase to be guessed by another person. This person then guesses letters that he/she thinks is in the word/phrase.

UPDATED: Now comes with a word bank of hard words that is randomly selected from the textfile given. Make sure if you use another file that you either update the file path in the code or rename the file to 'HangmanWords.txt'. Can now repeatedly play the game. Each session cannot have the same word twice.
